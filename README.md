## Computational Physics Simulations

This repository contains numerical simulations of classical models studied in statistical and computational physics, including:

- Ising model (Monte Carlo simulations, phase transitions)
- Molecular dynamics (energy conservation, equilibration)
- Percolation models
- Schelling segregation model

Each project includes:
- Model description
- Numerical method
- Key observables and results

The goal of this repository is to study emergent behavior in dynamical systems using reproducible computational methods.
